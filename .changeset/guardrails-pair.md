Guardrails: per-node resource cap + reflection fact sanitizer.

**Per-node `budget`** — new optional `budget: { max_tokens?, max_cost_usd? }` field on every node. Enforced after each successful execution; breaching either cap throws the new `NodeBudgetExceededError` (barrel-exported) and stops the workflow immediately. Stops a runaway annealing loop or oversized reflection extraction from eating the entire workflow budget. Independent from `state.budget_usd` / `state.max_token_budget`, which keep guarding the run as a whole.

**`factSanitizer` on `GraphRunnerOptions`** — new optional pre-write hook applied to every fact emitted by a `reflection` node before it reaches `memoryWriter`. Returning `null` drops the fact; returning a modified fact substitutes it. Used for PII redaction, policy filtering, content moderation at the memory-write boundary. Errors thrown by the sanitizer are logged (`fact_sanitizer_failed`) and the original fact passes through — a downed PII service must not block compound learning. New type barrel-exported: `FactSanitizer`.
