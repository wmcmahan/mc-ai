# Supervisor Routing

A 4-node cyclic hub-and-spoke workflow where a Supervisor agent dynamically routes work between Research, Write, and Edit specialists using LLM-powered decisions. Demonstrates the supervisor pattern, cyclic graphs, dynamic routing, and the `__done__` sentinel for termination.

## Graph

    supervisor -- route --> research

    edit -- return --> supervisor

```

## State Slicing

Each node only sees the keys it declares — the engine enforces zero-trust boundaries. The supervisor has full visibility to make routing decisions.

    block:state["WorkflowState (blackboard)"]:4
        goal constraints research_notes draft final_draft
    end

    space:4

    block:sv["supervisor node"]
        sv_read["reads: *"]
        sv_write["writes: *"]
    end

    block:rn["research node"]
        r_read["reads: goal, constraints"]
        r_write["writes: research_notes"]
    end

    block:wn["write node"]
        w_read["reads: goal, research_notes"]
        w_write["writes: draft"]
    end

    block:en["edit node"]
        e_read["reads: goal, draft"]
        e_write["writes: final_draft"]
    end
```
