# Streaming

A 2-node linear workflow consumed via `stream()` instead of `run()`. Demonstrates real-time event handling including token-by-token output, typed event discrimination, and the `isTerminalEvent()` type guard.

## Lifecycle & State

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Caller
    participant R as GraphRunner
    participant RN as research (agent)
    participant WN as write (agent)
    participant S as WorkflowState

    U->>R: runner.stream()
    R->>S: status = running
    Note over S: memory: {}

    R->>RN: execute (reads: goal, constraints)
    loop token-by-token
        RN-->>U: agent:token_delta
    end
    RN->>S: reducer: set memory.research_notes
    Note over S: memory: { research_notes: "..." }

    R->>R: persist state, follow edge

    R->>WN: execute (reads: goal, research_notes)
    loop token-by-token
        WN-->>U: agent:token_delta
    end
    WN->>S: reducer: set memory.draft
    Note over S: memory: { research_notes: "...", draft: "..." }

    R->>S: status = completed
    R-->>U: workflow:complete (terminal event)
```

## Stream Events

The `stream()` method yields typed `StreamEvent` objects. This example handles every event type:

| Event | When | Payload Highlights |
|-------|------|--------------------|
| `workflow:start` | Workflow begins | `run_id` |
| `node:start` | A node begins execution | `node_id`, `node_type` |
| `agent:token_delta` | Each token arrives from the LLM | `token` |
| `node:complete` | A node finishes | `node_id`, `duration_ms` |
| `action:applied` | A state reducer fires | `action_type`, `node_id` |
| `state:persisted` | State saved to persistence | `iteration` |
| `node:retry` | A node retries after failure | `node_id`, `attempt`, `backoff_ms` |
| `budget:threshold_reached` | Cost crosses a budget threshold | `threshold_pct`, `budget_usd` |
| `workflow:complete` | Workflow finishes successfully | `state` (terminal) |
| `workflow:failed` | Workflow fails | `state`, `error` (terminal) |

Terminal events are detected with the `isTerminalEvent()` type guard, which narrows the event type to `workflow:complete | workflow:failed`.

## State Slicing

```mermaid

    columns 3

    block:state["WorkflowState (blackboard)"]:3
        goal constraints research_notes draft
    end

    space:3

    block:rn["research node"]
        r_read["reads: goal, constraints"]
        r_write["writes: research_notes"]
    end

    space

    block:wn["write node"]
        w_read["reads: goal, research_notes"]
        w_write["writes: draft"]
    end
```

## Key Concepts

- **`stream()` vs `run()`**: `run()` returns the final state; `stream()` yields every event as an `AsyncGenerator<StreamEvent>`, enabling real-time UIs, progress bars, and token-by-token rendering
- **Token streaming**: `agent:token_delta` events deliver each token as it arrives from the LLM — write directly to `stdout` for a typewriter effect
- **Typed event discrimination**: Use a `switch` on `event.type` to handle each event with full TypeScript narrowing
- **`isTerminalEvent()` guard**: A type guard that narrows `StreamEvent` to terminal variants, making it safe to access `event.state` and detect completion or failure
- **Same graph, different consumption**: The graph definition is identical to the `research-and-write` example — only the runner call changes from `run()` to `stream()`
