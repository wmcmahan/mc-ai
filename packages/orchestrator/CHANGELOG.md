## 0.1.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- d3641f2: Guardrails: per-node resource cap + reflection fact sanitizer.

  **Per-node `budget`** — new optional `budget: { max_tokens?, max_cost_usd? }` field on every node. Enforced after each successful execution; breaching either cap throws the new `NodeBudgetExceededError` (barrel-exported) and stops the workflow immediately. Stops a runaway annealing loop or oversized reflection extraction from eating the entire workflow budget. Independent from `state.budget_usd` / `state.max_token_budget`, which keep guarding the run as a whole.

  **`factSanitizer` on `GraphRunnerOptions`** — new optional pre-write hook applied to every fact emitted by a `reflection` node before it reaches `memoryWriter`. Returning `null` drops the fact; returning a modified fact substitutes it. Used for PII redaction, policy filtering, content moderation at the memory-write boundary. Errors thrown by the sanitizer are logged (`fact_sanitizer_failed`) and the original fact passes through — a downed PII service must not block compound learning. New type barrel-exported: `FactSanitizer`.

- d3641f2: Compound learning: `reflection` node type + `MemoryWriter` + tag-based retrieval.

  **@cycgraph/orchestrator**

  - New `reflection` node type that distills `source_keys` from workflow memory into atomic facts and persists them via an injected `MemoryWriter`. Two extractor variants:
    - `rule_based` — deterministic sentence-level extraction, no LLM call
    - `llm` — uses the new `extractFactsExecutor` primitive via a structured-output agent
  - New `MemoryWriter` adapter type on `GraphRunnerOptions` (mirrors `MemoryRetriever`).
  - New `extractFactsExecutor` primitive (sibling to `evaluateQualityExecutor`) for LLM-based fact distillation.
  - New `memory_query` directive on `GraphNode` — declares per-node retrieval (text / entity_ids / tags / max_facts). When set, the runner calls `memoryRetriever` before agent / supervisor prompt construction and renders results into a `## Relevant Memory` section ahead of the workflow-state `<data>` block. Voting and evolution nodes propagate `memory_query` to synthetic sub-nodes automatically.
  - `MemoryRetriever` query type gained `tags?: string[]`.
  - New errors: `MemoryWriterMissingError` (barrel-exported).
  - New types barrel-exported: `MemoryWriter`, `MemoryWriterFact`, `MemoryWriterResult`, `FactExtractionResult`, `ReflectionConfig`, `MemoryQuery`.

  **@cycgraph/memory**

  - `SemanticFact.tags` and `MemoryQuery.tags` fields (both default `[]`).
  - New tag-only retrieval path in `retrieveMemory()` — list facts by tag, intersect tags, apply temporal validity, expand to themes and episodes. No embedding provider required.
  - Existing embedding and entity-based paths now also intersect with the `tags` filter.

  **@cycgraph/orchestrator-postgres**

  - New `memory_facts.tags` `jsonb` column (migration `0013_add_fact_tags`).
  - `DrizzleMemoryStore` and `DrizzleMemoryIndex` row mappers updated to read/write `tags`.

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- 2967433: Runner modularization, memory/persistence hardening, and dependency bumps.

  **@cycgraph/orchestrator**

  - Break up the monolithic `graph-runner.ts` into focused modules: `budget-monitor`, `executor-context-builder`, `fallback-tool-resolver`, `idempotency-tracker`, `memory-differ`, `persistence-coordinator`, `recover`, `router`, and `stream-channel`. Public API unchanged.
  - Add MCP `tool-circuit-breaker` and typed MCP error classes.
  - Add `runtime-config` module and expanded reducer + validation coverage.
  - Bump `@ai-sdk/anthropic` and OpenTelemetry packages.

  **@cycgraph/orchestrator-postgres**

  - Add retry helper around Drizzle persistence and event-log writes with covering tests.
  - Tighten event-log and persistence error handling.

  **@cycgraph/memory**

  - Improve `InMemoryMemoryIndex` (filtering, scoring) and adaptive memory compression with new test coverage.
