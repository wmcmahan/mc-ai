/**
 * Outcome Ledger
 *
 * Records the outcome score of workflow runs together with the memory
 * facts that were injected into them, accumulating the per-fact evidence
 * that drives eval-gated retention (see `retention-gate.ts`).
 *
 * The ledger is deliberately store-agnostic and async-only so a
 * database-backed implementation (e.g. a Drizzle `memory_run_outcomes`
 * table) can be added later without an interface change.
 *
 * Statistical caveat: per-fact means versus a leave-one-out baseline are
 * a heuristic, not causal inference. Facts are co-injected, and run
 * difficulty varies — the retention gate mitigates this with minimum
 * trial counts, margins, and soft-delete eviction (recoverable via
 * `include_invalidated`), but the signal remains correlational.
