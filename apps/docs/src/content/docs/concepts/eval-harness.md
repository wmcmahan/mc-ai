title: Eval Harness
description: Regression-eval harness and quality-assurance gate for @cycgraph/* packages.
---

The **Eval Harness** (`@cycgraph/evals`) is the regression-detection layer for the project. It runs golden trajectories through the real `@cycgraph/orchestrator`, `@cycgraph/memory`, and `@cycgraph/context-engine` packages, captures observable behavior, and tells you whether a change in one package silently broke another.

It's distinct from the orchestrator's lightweight built-in [`runEval`](/observability/evals/) (which is a per-graph assertion framework). `@cycgraph/evals` operates one level up — it gates whole-package behavior across release cycles.

## When to reach for this package

- You shipped a change to one package and want to know if it altered observable behavior elsewhere
- You want a stable signal for "did the LLM judge actually regress, or was it a flaky sample?"
- You want to detect drift that hides under your absolute gate (e.g., a suite going from 0% to 4% drift while the ceiling is 5%)
- You need a record of what the system *actually does* on a tagged commit so future regressions are attributable

### Two tracks, one gate

- **Deterministic track** — pure library calls in-process, no LLM. Fast (<1s), free, and produces sharp signal: segmentation, dedup, budget allocation, subgraph extraction, conflict detection, etc.
- **Semantic track** — SUT-driven: each trajectory is dispatched through the real package code via `runSutDispatch`, and the LLM judge grades the observed output against the recorded golden. Configurable provider (Ollama locally, GPT-4o in CI) and configurable sample count for stability.

Both tracks feed into a single `DriftReport` aggregated by `computeDrift()`. The gate triggers when aggregate drift exceeds the configured ceiling.

### Multi-sample stability

LLM judges are non-deterministic. A single low-scoring run can tank the gate; a single high-scoring run can mask a real regression. The semantic track defaults to **3 samples per metric in CI**, using a majority-vote outcome and surfacing tests with inconsistent results as **flaky** — distinct from drift failure.

See [Drift & Baselines](/concepts/drift-and-baselines/) for how flaky-vs-regressed is distinguished in the report.
