description: Zero Trust model, state slicing, permission enforcement, and economic guardrails.

MC-AI operates under a **Zero Trust** security model built on three assumptions:

1. **Input is malicious** — users and external data may contain injection attacks
2. **Agents are fallible** — LLMs can be jailbroken or manipulated
3. **State is leaky** — agents should only see what they need to see

Every layer of the engine enforces these assumptions through concrete mechanisms described below.

## State slicing (least privilege)

Agents never see the full `WorkflowState`. Each agent and node declares explicit permissions:

```typescript
const WRITER_ID = registry.register({
  name: 'Writer',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  provider: 'anthropic',
  system_prompt: '...',
  tools: [],
  permissions: {
    read_keys: ['goal', 'research_notes'],   // can only read these
    write_keys: ['draft'],                    // can only write this
  },
});
```

At runtime, the engine creates a **state view** — a filtered projection of `WorkflowState.memory` containing only the keys listed in `read_keys`. An agent configured with `read_keys: ['goal', 'research_notes']` receives `undefined` for every other key, including `db_credentials`, `api_keys`, or any other sensitive data in state.

The wildcard `read_keys: ['*']` grants access to all non-internal memory keys. Internal keys (prefixed with `_`, such as `_taint_registry`) are always excluded from state views.

### Dot-notation nested key filtering

State slicing supports **dot-notation paths** for fine-grained access to nested objects. Instead of granting access to an entire top-level key, you can restrict an agent to specific nested paths:

```typescript
const WRITER_ID = registry.register({
  name: 'Writer',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  provider: 'anthropic',
  system_prompt: '...',
  tools: [],
  permissions: {
    read_keys: ['user.name', 'user.email'],  // only these nested paths
    write_keys: ['draft'],
  },
});
```

An agent with `read_keys: ['user.name', 'user.email']` receives a filtered `user` object containing only `{ name, email }` — all other fields (e.g. `user.ssn`, `user.api_key`) are excluded from its state view.

## Write permission enforcement

Write permissions are enforced at two levels:

1. **Agent executor** — After the LLM call completes, `validateMemoryUpdatePermissions()` checks every key the agent wrote against its `write_keys`. Unauthorized writes throw `PermissionDeniedError`.

2. **Graph runner** — Before any action is applied to state, `validateAction()` re-validates the action against the node's `write_keys`. This second check catches edge cases where actions are constructed outside the agent executor.

```
Agent LLM call → validateMemoryUpdatePermissions() → validateAction() → Reducer → State
                  ↑ PermissionDeniedError             ↑ PermissionDeniedError
```

Internal keys (prefixed with `_`) are reserved for the engine. Agents are blocked from writing `_`-prefixed keys by the agent executor's validation layer (`extractMemoryUpdates` rejects them). The GraphRunner's `validateAction()` skips `_`-prefixed keys during permission checks — they are treated as trusted system metadata injected by the executor (e.g. `_taint_registry`), not as agent-authored writes.

## Prompt injection sanitization

All agent inputs pass through a sanitization pipeline before reaching the LLM. These sanitizers defend against known prompt injection techniques:

- **NFKC Unicode normalization** — Converts lookalike characters (e.g. Cyrillic homographs like `а` → `a`) to their canonical forms, preventing visual spoofing attacks.
- **Carriage return stripping** — Removes `\r` characters that can be used to hide injected instructions in terminal-style overwrite attacks.
- **Consecutive newline normalization** — Collapses runs of 3+ newlines to 2, preventing whitespace-based prompt boundary confusion.
- **Directional override stripping** — Removes Unicode bidirectional override characters (U+202A–U+202E, U+2066–U+2069) that can reverse visible text direction to disguise injected content.
- **Base64-encoded injection detection** — Detects and rejects inputs containing base64-encoded strings that decode to known injection patterns (e.g. `ignore previous instructions`).

These sanitizers run on all agent system prompts and user messages before LLM invocation.

## Taint tracking

External data is the most dangerous attack vector. MC-AI automatically tracks the provenance of data entering the system from external tools.

**How it works:**

1. **Flagging** — All MCP tool results are automatically wrapped with taint metadata (source type, tool name, server ID, timestamp) via `wrapToolWithTaint()`.
2. **Propagation** — When an agent reads tainted input keys and writes output, `propagateDerivedTaint()` marks the outputs as `derived`-tainted, preserving the chain of custody.
3. **Inspection** — Downstream nodes can call `isTainted(memory, key)` or `getTaintInfo(memory, key)` to check provenance before trusting inputs.

Taint metadata is stored in `memory._taint_registry` (a protected internal key invisible to agents).

### Strict taint mode

By default, tainted data in routing decisions produces a warning. Set `strict_taint: true` at the graph level to reject tainted data in routing decisions entirely:

```typescript
const graph = createGraph({
  name: 'High Security Workflow',
  strict_taint: true,  // reject tainted data in routing decisions
  nodes: [ /* ... */ ],
  edges: [ /* ... */ ],
  start_node: 'start',
  end_nodes: ['end'],
});
```

When `strict_taint` is enabled, conditional edge expressions that reference tainted keys evaluate to `false`, and supervisor nodes that receive tainted routing inputs will refuse to route. See [Taint Tracking](/concepts/taint-tracking/) for details on taint enforcement at decision points.

See [Taint Tracking](/concepts/taint-tracking/) for the full API reference.

## Economic guardrails

Prevent runaway costs, infinite loops, and denial-of-wallet attacks with layered limits:

### Token budget

Set `max_token_budget` on the workflow state. The engine tracks `total_tokens_used` across all LLM calls and throws `BudgetExceededError` when the limit is hit.

```typescript
const state = createWorkflowState({
  workflow_id: graph.id,
  goal: '...',
  max_token_budget: 50_000,
});
```

### Cost budget (USD)

Set `budget_usd` for dollar-denominated limits. The engine calculates costs using a per-model pricing table and fires threshold alerts at **50%**, **75%**, **90%**, and **100%** of the budget:

```typescript
const state = createWorkflowState({
  workflow_id: graph.id,
  goal: '...',
  budget_usd: 1.00,
});
```

At 100%, execution halts with `BudgetExceededError`. Listen for threshold events to add monitoring:

```typescript
runner.on('budget:threshold_reached', ({ percentage, total_cost_usd }) => {
  console.warn(`Budget ${percentage}% reached: $${total_cost_usd}`);
});
```

See [Cost & Budget Tracking](/concepts/cost-tracking/) for model pricing details and the `UsageRecorder` interface.

### Iteration limit

`max_iterations` (default: **50**) caps the total number of graph loop iterations. This prevents cyclic graphs from running forever:

```typescript
const state = createWorkflowState({
  workflow_id: graph.id,
  goal: '...',
  max_iterations: 20,
});
```

### Execution timeout

`max_execution_time_ms` (default: **1 hour**) sets a wall-clock deadline. The engine checks elapsed time before each node execution and throws `WorkflowTimeoutError` if exceeded:

```typescript
const state = createWorkflowState({
  workflow_id: graph.id,
  goal: '...',
  max_execution_time_ms: 120_000,  // 2 minutes
});
```

### Agent step limit

Each agent has a `max_steps` setting (default: **10**, maximum: **50**) that limits the number of tool-call iterations within a single LLM invocation. This prevents agents from entering infinite tool-call loops.

### Agent timeout

Each agent invocation has a **2-minute** timeout (configurable via `timeout_ms`). If the LLM call doesn't complete within the limit, an `AgentTimeoutError` is thrown and the node fails (subject to its retry policy).

## MCP tool security

Agents never see MCP server transport configurations or secrets.

### Trusted MCP Server Registry

Server connection configs (URLs, commands, auth headers) live in the **MCP Server Registry** — an admin-only data store. Agent configs reference servers by ID only:

```typescript
// Agent config — no transport details, no secrets
tools: [
  { type: 'mcp', server_id: 'web-search' },
]
```

### Access control

Each server entry can restrict which agents may use it via `allowed_agents`:

```typescript
await registry.saveServer({
  id: 'admin-tools',
  name: 'Admin Tools',
  transport: { type: 'http', url: 'https://internal.example.com/admin' },
  allowed_agents: ['admin-agent-001'],
});
```

When `allowed_agents` is set, the `MCPConnectionManager` validates the requesting agent's ID before resolving tools. Unauthorized access throws `MCPAccessDeniedError`.

### Transport restrictions

- **stdio** — Only allowlisted commands (`npx`, `node`, `python3`, `python`, `uvx`). No arbitrary shell execution.
- **http/sse** — URLs stored in the registry, never in agent configs. Secrets stay server-side.

### Automatic taint wrapping

All MCP tool results are wrapped with taint metadata before being returned to agents, ensuring every piece of external data is tracked from the moment it enters the system.

See [Tools & MCP](/concepts/tools-and-mcp/) for the full MCP integration guide.

## Supervisor routing validation

Supervisor nodes validate every LLM routing decision against their `managed_nodes` allowlist. If the LLM attempts to route to a node not in the list, a `SupervisorRoutingError` is thrown. This prevents prompt injection attacks from hijacking workflow control flow.

## Human-in-the-loop as security

For high-stakes actions, use `approval` nodes to pause execution for human review:

1. A preceding node proposes an action and saves it to state
2. The workflow pauses at the approval gate (status becomes `waiting`)
3. A human reviews and approves or rejects
4. Execution resumes only after approval

See [Human-in-the-Loop](/patterns/human-in-the-loop/) for the implementation pattern.

## Immutable audit trail

Every state transition is logged as an action with:
- Which node produced it
- When it was applied
- What the previous state was
- An idempotency key (`{node_id}:{iteration_count}`) to prevent duplicate execution on retries

This enables full audit trails and time-travel debugging via the event log.

## Error classes

All security-related errors are typed and exported from `@mcai/orchestrator`:

| Error | Thrown when |
|-------|------------|
| `PermissionDeniedError` | Agent writes to unauthorized memory key |
| `BudgetExceededError` | Token or cost budget exceeded |
| `WorkflowTimeoutError` | Execution time exceeds `max_execution_time_ms` |
| `AgentTimeoutError` | Single agent call exceeds timeout |
| `MCPAccessDeniedError` | Agent not in server's `allowed_agents` list |
| `MCPServerNotFoundError` | Server ID not found in registry |
| `SupervisorRoutingError` | Supervisor routes to unauthorized node |
