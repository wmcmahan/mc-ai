title: Evolution (DGM)
description: Population-based selection — run N candidates in parallel, score them, and breed the next generation.
---

The **Evolution** pattern—inspired by Darwin Godel Machines—runs multiple candidate solutions in parallel, scores each with a fitness evaluator, selects the best, and "breeds" the next generation using the winner's output as context. 

This process continues across multiple generations until a specific fitness threshold is met or a stagnation condition is reached. Here, the LLM acts as the mutation operator: by supplying the winning parent as context alongside a calculated temperature, its stochastic creativity produces deliberate variation.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Start([Start]) --> G0

    subgraph G0["Generation 0"]
        direction LR
        A0["Candidate A"] ~~~ B0["Candidate B"] ~~~ C0["Candidate C"]
    end

    G0 --> Eval0["Evaluate All → Winner (0.72)"]
    Eval0 --> G1

    subgraph G1["Generation 1"]
        direction LR
        A1["Candidate A'"] ~~~ B1["Candidate B'"] ~~~ C1["Candidate C'"]
    end

    G1 --> Eval1["Evaluate All → Winner (0.85)"]
    Eval1 --> G2

    subgraph G2["Generation 2"]
        direction LR
        A2["Candidate A''"] ~~~ B2["Candidate B''"] ~~~ C2["Candidate C''"]
    end

    G2 --> Eval2["Evaluate All → Winner (0.91) ✓ Done"]
    Eval2 --> Done([Done])
```

Each generation follows a strict loop:
1. N candidates run in parallel (fan-out).
2. Each candidate receives the previous generation's winner injected into its prompt.
3. A fitness evaluator agent scores each candidate on a 0–1 scale.
4. The highest-scoring candidate becomes the parent for the next generation.
5. Temperature decreases linearly (moving from broad exploration to focused exploitation).
6. Execution halts when the fitness threshold is met, stagnation is detected, or max generations are reached.

## When to use this pattern

- **Creative problem solving**: When there are many wildly different valid approaches and you want to explore the landscape simultaneously.
- **Prompt optimization**: Allowing an LLM to rewrite its own prompt instructions iteratively to find the highest-performing variant.
- **Out-of-the-box solutions**: Finding non-obvious solutions where a single, sequential self-annealing agent might get stuck in a local maximum.

*(Note: Evolution is resource intensive. If you only need to iteratively refine a single output until it hits a quality bar, use [Self-Annealing](/patterns/self-annealing/) instead.)*

## Implementation example

The pattern requires you to pair a "candidate" generator agent with an "evaluator" agent within an `evolution` node.

### 1. The Agents

Register the candidate agent that will generate variations, and the evaluator agent that will score their fitness.

```typescript
import { InMemoryAgentRegistry } from '@mcai/orchestrator';

const registry = new InMemoryAgentRegistry();

const WRITER_ID = registry.register({
  name: 'Candidate Writer',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  provider: 'anthropic',
  system_prompt: [
    'You are a creative writer.',
    'Write a poem based on the prompt.',
    'If `_evolution_parent` is provided, use it as a starting point. The parent scored `_evolution_parent_fitness`—aim to do better.',
    'Current generation: `_evolution_generation`.',
  ].join(' '),
  // Temperature is overridden by the evolution node dynamically
  temperature: 1.0, 
  tools: [],
  permissions: { read_keys: ['prompt'], write_keys: ['poem'] },
});

const EVALUATOR_ID = registry.register({
  name: 'Fitness Evaluator',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  provider: 'anthropic',
  system_prompt: [
    'Evaluate the poem strictly on its metrical structure and emotional impact.',
    'Return a single number between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the quality score.',
  ].join(' '),
  temperature: 0.1,
  tools: [],
  permissions: { read_keys: ['poem'], write_keys: ['score'] },
});
```

### 2. The Evolution Node

The `evolution` node type requires an `evolution_config` block that dictates the population size, selection strategy, and stopping conditions.

```typescript
import { createGraph } from '@mcai/orchestrator';

const graph = createGraph({
  name: 'Poem Evolution',
  nodes: [
    {
      id: 'evolve-poem',
      type: 'evolution',
      read_keys: ['*'],
      write_keys: ['*'],
      evolution_config: {
        candidate_agent_id: WRITER_ID,
        evaluator_agent_id: EVALUATOR_ID,
        population_size: 5,        // Parallel candidates per generation
        max_generations: 10,       // Hard limit
        fitness_threshold: 0.9,    // Early exit score
        stagnation_generations: 3, // Exit if no improvement
        selection_strategy: 'rank',// Always select the top scorer
        initial_temperature: 1.0,  // Exploration (Generation 0)
        final_temperature: 0.3,    // Exploitation (Final Generation)
      },
    },
  ],
  edges: [],
  start_node: 'evolve-poem',
  end_nodes: ['evolve-poem'],
});
```

## Core concepts

### Prompt Context Injection

Each candidate receives the previous generation's winner automatically in its state view. Your candidate agent's system prompt must explicitly address these variables to "mutate" successfully:

> "If `_evolution_parent` is provided, use it as a starting point. The parent scored `_evolution_parent_fitness`—aim to do better. Current generation: `_evolution_generation`."

### Cost Considerations

Evolution executes a massive amount of LLM calls. With a population size of 5 and max generations of 10, you are triggering up to 50 candidate executions plus 50 evaluations. 

You can configure `error_strategy: 'best_effort'` on your node to gracefully handle occasional downstream API timeouts without failing the entire generation. Always set a conservative `fitness_threshold` so the loop exits as early as possible.
