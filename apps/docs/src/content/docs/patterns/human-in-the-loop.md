title: Human-in-the-Loop
description: Pause workflows for human review with approval gates.
---

The **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** pattern allows workflows to pause mid-execution, wait for human input or approval, and resume exactly where they left off without losing state or context.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Agent["Writer Agent"] --> Approval{"Approval Gate"}
    Approval --> |"Workflow pauses"| Wait(["⏸ Waiting for human"])
    Wait --> |"Human reviews"| Decision{Approved?}
    Decision --> |"Yes"| Resume["Workflow resumes"]
    Decision --> |"No"| Reject["Route to rejection node/retry"]
    Resume --> Next["Publisher Agent"]
```

1. **Execution**: A workflow proceeds normally until it hits a node of type `approval`.
2. **Pause**: The orchestrator completely halts execution, persists the current state to the database, and emits a `workflow:waiting` event.
3. **Review**: The system waits. Human operators can take seconds or days to review the data via a UI or ChatOps integration.
4. **Resume**: An API call is made back to the orchestrator supplying the human's decision (e.g., approved/rejected) and optional feedback.
5. **Continuation**: The workflow wakes up, injects the human's response into the state memory, and traverses the next edge.

## Implementation example

This example demonstrates a classic approval gate: A Writer agent drafts an article, execution pauses for a human to review the draft, and then upon approval, a Publisher agent finalizes it.

See the [full runnable code](https://github.com/wmcmahan/mc-ai/tree/main/packages/orchestrator/examples/human-in-the-loop/human-in-the-loop.ts).

### 1. The Approval Node

Instead of managing complex pausing logic in code, you simply declare an `approval` node in your `createGraph` definition.

```typescript
import { createGraph } from '@mcai/orchestrator';

const graph = createGraph({
  name: 'Human-in-the-Loop',
  nodes: [
    // ... writer agent node ...
    {
      id: 'review',
      type: 'approval',
      read_keys: ['*'],
      write_keys: ['*', 'control_flow'],
      approval_config: {
        approval_type: 'human_review',
        prompt_message: 'Please review the draft before publication.',
        review_keys: ['draft'], // The specific memory keys the human needs to see
        timeout_ms: 300_000,    // Hard timeout if the human never responds
      },
    },
    // ... publisher agent node ...
  ],
  edges: [
    { source: 'write', target: 'review' },
    { source: 'review', target: 'publish' },
  ],
  start_node: 'write',
  end_nodes: ['publish'],
});
```

### 2. The Initial Run

When you execute the workflow, it will automatically pause when it reaches the `review` node.

```typescript
const runner1 = new GraphRunner(graph, initialState, {
  persistStateFn: async (s) => persistence.saveWorkflowState(s),
});

// The run() promise resolves early with a 'waiting' status
const pausedState = await runner1.run();

if (pausedState.status === 'waiting') {
  const pending = pausedState.memory._pending_approval;
  
  // E.g. Send to Slack: 
  // "Please review the draft before publication."
  // "\nDraft content: " + pending.review_data.draft
  console.log(pending.prompt_message);
  console.log(pending.review_data.draft);
}
```

### 3. Resuming the Workflow

Later, when your user clicks "Approve" or "Reject" in your UI, you instantiate a new `GraphRunner` with the persisted state, apply their response, and run it again.

```typescript
// 1. Fetch the paused state from your DB
const stateFromDB = await persistence.getWorkflowState(workflowId);

// 2. Create a fresh runner
const runner2 = new GraphRunner(graph, stateFromDB, {
  persistStateFn: async (s) => persistence.saveWorkflowState(s),
});

// 3. Inject the human's decision
runner2.applyHumanResponse({
  decision: 'approved',
  data: 'Looks great, but make the headline punchier.', // Optional feedback
});

// 4. Resume execution
const finalState = await runner2.run();
```

When the workflow resumes:
- The human's `decision` string is saved to state memory under `human_decision`.
- The human's `data` string is saved to state memory under `human_response`.
- The downstream agents (like the Publisher) can read these fields to incorporate the feedback into their final output.

## Approval gate timeouts

When `timeout_ms` is set on an approval node, the engine sets `waiting_timeout_at` on the workflow state to the current time plus the timeout duration. This creates a hard deadline for human response.

If the workflow is resumed after the deadline has expired, the engine transitions the workflow to `timeout` status immediately with a `WorkflowTimeoutError` — the human's response is discarded and execution does not continue. This prevents workflows from waiting indefinitely for human approval that may never come.

```typescript
{
  id: 'review',
  type: 'approval',
  approval_config: {
    approval_type: 'human_review',
    prompt_message: 'Approve deployment to production?',
    review_keys: ['deployment_plan'],
    timeout_ms: 600_000,  // 10-minute deadline
  },
}
```

If no human responds within 10 minutes and a resume is attempted after that window, the workflow fails with `WorkflowTimeoutError`. To handle timeouts gracefully, check `state.status === 'timeout'` in your application code and trigger appropriate fallback logic.

## Worker-based HITL

When using the [WorkflowWorker](/concepts/distributed-execution/) for distributed execution, HITL is handled without blocking any worker:

1. The API enqueues a `{ type: 'start' }` job
2. A worker runs the workflow until it hits an approval node → returns `status: 'waiting'`
3. The worker calls `queue.release(jobId)` — transitions the job to `paused` status, freeing the slot immediately (no blocking). The paused job is **not** re-claimable by `dequeue`, so the worker won't re-execute the approval gate.
4. Later, the API acks the original paused job (cleanup) and enqueues a `{ type: 'resume', human_response: { decision: 'approved' } }` job
5. A worker (same or different) picks up the resume job, recovers via event log, applies the response, and continues

```typescript
import { InMemoryWorkflowQueue } from '@mcai/orchestrator';

const queue = new InMemoryWorkflowQueue();

// 1. Start the workflow
await queue.enqueue({
  type: 'start',
  run_id: runId,
  graph_id: graph.id,
  initial_state: { goal: 'Write an article' },
});

// 2. Worker runs it, hits approval node, releases the job (→ paused status)

// 3. Later, when the human approves:
await queue.ack(startJobId);  // Clean up the paused original job
await queue.enqueue({
  type: 'resume',
  run_id: runId,       // Same run
  graph_id: graph.id,
  human_response: { decision: 'approved', data: 'Looks great!' },
});
```

The key distinction: `release` (not `nack`) transitions the job to `paused` status without counting it as a failure. Paused jobs are not re-claimable by `dequeue` — this prevents the worker from re-executing the approval gate in a loop while awaiting a human response. A separate `resume` job carries the human's response.

## When to use this pattern

- **High-stakes actions**: An agent proposes a production deployment, financial transaction, or email blast, but a human must sign off before execution.
- **Content publication**: A writer agent produces a draft article, and a human editor reviews and approves it before publishing.
- **Compliance & Auditing**: Automated analysis that requires a mandatory human compliance review before proceeding.
- **Iterative feedback**: A human provides specific, nuanced feedback during the pause, which is fed back to the agent for revision (creating a Human-in-the-Loop + [Self-Annealing](/patterns/self-annealing/) hybrid).
